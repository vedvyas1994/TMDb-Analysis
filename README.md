## Dataset:
The dataset contains information for about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb) which includes information about the movies such as its cast, director, year of release, budget, revenue along with user ratings. There were some quality issues with the dataset that I have addressed and cleaned so as to refine the quality of my analysis.


## Summary of Findings & Key Insights:

1. The highest number of movies were released in year 2011 followed by 2010 and 2009.

2. Drama is the most released genre of all time, followed by comedy, thriller and action.

3. The actor with most number of movie releases of all time was Matt Damon followed by Ryan Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg.
